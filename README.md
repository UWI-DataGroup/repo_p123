We investigate the effects of growth on selected sickle cell disease outcomes. We do this in two ways:
- The effect of early life growth on outcomes at 10-years of age
- The effect of childhood growth (to 18-years) on later-life outcomes

An initial analysis was performed by ian Hambleton in (ahem...) 2004. We now update this analysis, with a view to publication.

For descriptions of the `.do` files, [see the project wiki](https://github.com/UWI-DataGroup/repo_p123/wiki)
